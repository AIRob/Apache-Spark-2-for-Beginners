#Apache Spark 2 for Beginners
This is the code repository for [Apache Spark 2 for Beginners](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/apache-spark-2-beginners?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785885006), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
Python 3.5.0 (v3.5.0:374f501f4567, Sep 12 2015, 11:00:19)
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin
```

Spark 2.0.0 or above is to be installed on at least a standalone machine to run the code samples and do further activities to learn more about the subject. For Spark Stream Processing, Kafka needs to be installed and configured as a message broker with its command line producer producing messages and the application developed using Spark as a consumer of those messages.
